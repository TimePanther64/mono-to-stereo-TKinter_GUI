# stereo-to-ambisonic
A GUI which gives users the option to convert either a single stereo audio file to an ambisonic audio file 
or do a batch conversion of several audio files with a few extra features integrated. 

The entire GUI is divided into three tabs:

-The first tab is the aforementioned stereo to ambiosonic converter with single file or batch file conversion.

-The second tab consists of a few options to change audio file features such as volume, reverberation, bass and treble.

-The third tab is a very basic add removal system that removes ad segments at the beginning and end of the audio file.

The GUI is programmed using the TKinter library and the audio files are processed using pydub and librosa libraries.
